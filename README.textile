h1. OKDocco

Recursive documentation generator for your Rails app.

Uses Docco -- "http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/":http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/

h2. Usage

notextile. By default it generates documentation for <tt>app</tt> and this file.

Optionally call it with several files on the commandline to document those instead.

See the output of Docco on the script itself here: "http://julescarbon.github.com/okdocco/":http://julescarbon.github.com/okdocco/

Note that the default Docco installation does not mention Perl's comment character, so add it in around line 121.
